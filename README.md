# APCSP: A-Frame Demo Earth and Moon

A-Frame demonstration program with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

## Getting Started

Log in to your Cloud 9 account and create a new HTML 5 workspace.  When you're creating the workspace you must clone the [repo](https://github.com/JaffeAPCSP/aframe-demo-earth-moon.git) to initialize your workspace.

## Start the web server

In the Cloud 9 terminal enter the comment <code>sudo service start apache2</code>

## Opening the webpage

* Click the Share link in the top right corner of your Cloud 9 workspace
* Click the middle link, then click Copy
* Open a new web browser window and paste the URL you just copied

You'll see a 3D page with a rotating Earth and the moon orbiting the Earth

## Explore the code

Open the <code>index.html</code> and javascript files in the <code>js</code> folder.  Make small adjustments in the code, save the changes, then reload the webpage to see the effect of your changes.

See if you can adjust the code to do the following:

* Make the Earth spin slower
* Make the Earth spin the other way
* Change the orbit of the moon so that it's elliptical (the x-radius is different from the z-radius)
* Add another satellite that is orange in color that is in a different orbit than the moon.
